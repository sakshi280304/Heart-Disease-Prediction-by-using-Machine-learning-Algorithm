# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project predicts the likelihood of **heart disease** in patients using **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
It aims to support healthcare decisions by analyzing patient data and identifying risk factors early.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Implementation of ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN  
- Model comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Final prediction model to classify patients as "At Risk" or "Not At Risk"  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **pandas, numpy** â€“ data handling  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** â€“ visualization  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ machine learning
